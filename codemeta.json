    "description": "QAC (Quick Array Combinations) is a front end to CASA (ascl:1107.013) and calls tools and tasks to help in combining data from a single dish and interferometer. QAC hides some of the complexity of writing CASA scripts and provide a simple interface to array combination tools and tasks in CASA. This project was conceived alongside the TP2VIS (ascl:1904.021) project, where it was used to provide an easier way to call CASA and perform regression tests.",
