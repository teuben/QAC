Here we list contributed software, as well as usage tips.


tp2vis:     this may or may not be an old version of tp2vis that we
            distribute just in case the formal one on
	    https://github.com/tp2vis/distribute is not available
	    or deemed outdated.	    					
	    Do not use this unless you know what you are doing and/or
	    have spoken to the developers.
	    This version has likely untested features as well.

test_ssc:   Faridina's method  (now in: src/ssc.py as qac_ssc())

"Customising the Right-Click Menu"
  Dolphin (KDE, Linux) 
  Nautilus (Linux)     -> place script (or symlink?) in ~/.local/share/nautilus/scripts/
  Finder (OSX

casaviewer.desktop:     copy this file to your ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus
			for the Dolphin KDE tool to right-click open casaviewer

			mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus
			cp casaviewer.desktop ~/.local/share/kservices5/ServiceMenus

			If you are a KDE user, you will quickly appreciate being able
			to directly right click into a directory that's a CASA image
